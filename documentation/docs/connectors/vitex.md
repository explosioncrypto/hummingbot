## Miscellaneous Info

### Minimum Order Sizes

Minimum order sizes will vary by trading pair. 
Typically, the minimum value of an order must be at least 0.0001 BTC, 0.001 ETH, 50 VITE or 1 USDT.

### Transaction Fees

Transactions on the Vite blockchain do not consume gas like those on Ethereum, but another resource referred to as “quota.” 
Traders will need to stake VITE in order to obtain the required quota.

The ViteX trading fees will be paid out in “basic currencies” such as VITE, ETH, BTC and USDT.
There are two types of fee charges:

1\. ViteX charges a Base Trading Fee of 0.2%. 

2\. ViteX Operators running their own trading zones may charge an additional fee ("Operator Fee") up to 0.2%. 

In other words, the minimum fees that a trader will pay is 0.2% (Base Trading Fee + 0 Operator Fee) and the maximum is 0.4% (Base Trading Fee + 0.2% Operator Fee). 

The above fees are the same for both the makers and the takers.

A trader can choose to stake 10,000 (or 1,000,000) VITE to lower the Base Trading Fee from 0.2% to 0.1% (or 0%). 
However, any additional Operator fees will remain the same.
